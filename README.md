# About me
## My Interests
 * I like to listen to music in my free time and sing. I also love astronomy because I think space is a really interesting place.

## Websites I recommend
 * [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) - I love this website because like I said in my interests, I love listening to music because it makes me relax from a long day and generally put me in a good mood.
 * [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - I also love this website because it has a wide variety of subjects with helpful videos and articles. Also you can test your knowledge from taking the quizzes and tests.
