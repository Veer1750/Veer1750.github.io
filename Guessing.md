* **Start**: The game begins.
* **Generate Random Number**: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated by the program.
* **Ask User to Guess the Number**: The user is prompted to input their guess.
* **Input Validation**: The input is checked to ensure it's a valid numeric guess within the required range.
  * If the input is invalid (e.g., non-numeric or out of range), an error message is shown, and the user is asked to input their guess again.
* **Check Guess**: The program checks if the user's guess matches the randomly generated number.
  * If the guess is correct, the game displays a "Correct!" message and ends.
  * If the guess is incorrect, the program checks if the guess is too high or too low.
* **Display Feedback**: Depending on whether the guess is too high or too low, the game will display the appropriate message and prompt the user to guess again.
